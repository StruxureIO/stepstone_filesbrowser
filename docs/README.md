The file browser works in conjunction with the Files HumHub module. The Files HumHub 
module allows an administrator to add files for viewing or download from a HumHub space. 
Files are saved in a way that obscures that file path and file name and only with the correct 
hashed URL can a file be accessed. The file browser is a global module that accesses the files 
module's data and allows folders and links to files to be accessed out side of the space. 
 
To add a folder in the Files module, go to the space containing the module, click the Files link 
in the menu, and then click the Add Directory button. Enter a directory name in the popup 
window that appears, an optional description and also check the public checkbox. Then click 
the Save button. The new folder will be added and opened. Now, new files can be added to the 
newly created folder. Click the Add File button, to display the file dialog box and select a file to 
upload. Once uploaded you can verify that the file is now available in the file browser by visiting 
the file browser where clicking on the folder contains it and then clicking on the file. 

To edit or delete files or folders right click the item.
